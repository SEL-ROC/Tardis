1: Improve communications protocol.   Remove name from autoname sockets.   Make early messages compliant
    with other messages.   Route all traffic after initial config through Messages.
2: Break server code into two components, communications and sockets, and backend server proper.
   Drive the server, as much as possible, from the communications side, rather than vice versa.
3: Directly connect the server to the client via null messages, allowing local integration.
4: Create SSH/stdin/stdout communications to allow "serverless" remote connections.
5: Update metadata format to allow better tracking of which files use this data.   Improve handling of ranges.  
   Write emergency recovery code.
6: ASYNCIO client
7: Out-of-band send and receive, to different locations/URL's.
8: End directory chunking.   Allow NULL for open ended files.
